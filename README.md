This repo contains all the developmental data of creating a low cost 3D scanner with Arduino. Remember to read README before start building your own one as not all of the version will works.

* Each edition of the 3D Scanner might contain different license information. If a certain version of the scanner do not include a LICNESE file and/or information, the license in this directory (i.e. GNU License) will be used.
